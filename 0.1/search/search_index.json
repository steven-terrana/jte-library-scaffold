Building the Docs To build the documentation, run: just build This will build the documentation and produce static html in the site directory. Live Reloading To see changes live as you make them, run: just serve The documentation will be accessible at http://localhost:8000. Running Tests To run all the tests, run: just test The gradle test report is published to target/reports/tests/test/index.html .
